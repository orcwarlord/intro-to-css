<h1>Using the class selector</h1>
<p>The class selector is considered to be the most useful and efficient way of applying CSS to a document. It has the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We can re-use the class selector in many different parts of a page</li>
    <li>We can use multiple classes to build up more complex visual effects</li>
</ul>
<p>Before using tag selectors, think about using class selectors instead.</p>
